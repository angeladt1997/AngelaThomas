      <p>Angela Thomas is a Mississippi native looking to make her mark on the world from Dallas, Texas.</p>
        <hr>
        Angela is ready to work with programmers around the world to make her dreams and the dreams of others a technological reality. Angela has been looking for ways to integrate her love for technology with her love for dancing for years. Right now, Angela is learning the tools to launch a software application for choreographers to stage whole pieces before the rehearsal process even starts! In order to execute such software, Angela is learning the following coding methods:
        <ol>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>HTML</li>
        </ol>
       <p>Angela is a classically trained choreographer, specializing in the art forms of ballet, modern, and improvisation. Angela composes pieces to stand-out musical scores where dancers push their bodies to the limits. In each piece Angela produces, each dancer gets creative voice and choice on their involvement of the choreographic process and the performance of the work. </p>

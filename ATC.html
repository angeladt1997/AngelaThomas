       I am ready to work with programmers around 
       the world to make my dreams and the dreams of 
       others a technological reality. I have been 
       looking for ways to integrate my love for technology 
       with my other talents for years. I have done extensive
       learning and refining of the tools to launch my goals forward. 
       As of now, my coding knowledge lies within these realms:

        view the steps for pieces you are authorized to see. This app was made using postgres for backend data,

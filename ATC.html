     <p>
       I am ready to work with programmers around 
       the world to make my dreams and the dreams of 
       others a technological reality. I have been 
       looking for ways to integrate my love for technology 
       with my other talents for years. I have done extensive
       learning and refining of the tools to launch my goals forward. 
       As of now, my coding knowledge lies within these realms:
       <ul>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>HTML5</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>React</li>
          <li>Node</li>
          <li>PostgreSQL</li>
          <li>Vercel</li>
          <li>Github</li>
          <li>Heroku CLI</li>
      </ul>

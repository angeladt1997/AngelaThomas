      <h1> About the Founder</h1>
      <img src="STUDIO6-images/angela-dancing.png" width="250" alt="Angela, the Founder" class="center">
      <p>Angela Thomas is a Mississippi native looking to make her mark on the world from Dallas, Texas.</p>
        <hr>
        Angela is ready to work with programmers around the world to make her dreams and the dreams of others a technological reality. Angela has been looking for ways to integrate her love for technology with her love for dancing for years. Right now, Angela is learning the tools to launch a software application for choreographers to stage whole pieces before the rehearsal process even starts! In order to execute such software, Angela is learning the following coding methods:
        <ol>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>HTML</li>
        </ol>
       <p>Angela is a classically trained choreographer, specializing in the art forms of ballet, modern, and improvisation. Angela composes pieces to stand-out musical scores where dancers push their bodies to the limits. In each piece Angela produces, each dancer gets creative voice and choice on their involvement of the choreographic process and the performance of the work. </p>

                 <p>Choreo-Graph is a work in process! It's design is the answer to a question that Angela has been asking for years- How can I express my love for movement and its creation when I do not have dancers or a studio? Or, how can dancers and other on stage performers understand an artist's concept when they have never seen it? The goal of Choreo-Graph is to allow choreographers to have movements, phrases, and stage settings all in one place to design full pieces without dancers present. Angela has multiple journals of written choreography that she would like to bring to life. As the kinks are being worked out, Angela is busy learning the necessary tools to make this user-friendly software available to the public!</p>
             <p>Stay tuned for updates on the release of ChoreoGraph! See the progress of the app's development here:<a href="<a href="#"></a></p>

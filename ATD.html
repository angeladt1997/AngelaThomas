    <p>I am a classically trained choreographer, specializing 
       in the art forms of ballet, modern, and improvisation. 
       I like to  compose pieces to stand-out musical scores 
       where dancers push their bodies to the limits. In each piece 
       I produce, each dancer gets creative voice and choice on their 
       involvement of the choreographic process and the performance of the work.
       Most of my movement stems from my fascination with architecture 
       and the mannerisms of people around me. My vision has been
       known to test the limits of my own body, the physicality of movers
       and critical thinking of audiences across multiple states.

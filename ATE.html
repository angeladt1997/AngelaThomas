    <p>
        I believe there is nothing more precious on this
        Earth than the spirit of a child, no matter how old.
        In an attempt to help nurture and cultivate strong
        leaders of tomorrow, I spend my today lending a smile 
        and a helping hand to our future.

        I have had the pleasure of working with students 
        in Tennessee and in Texas. I have been Ms. Angela the
        friend, teacher, mentor, and most of all cheerleader
        for students of all backgrounds and ethnicities. 
        It is my goal to be sure that children have solid footing
        and consistency in their lives.

        <br>

        The only way the sun will come up bright tomorrow is
        if we safely guide it to safety today.

        <p>
            Since the age of 8, I have been trying to get as involved
            in the arts as possible. My journey started by chance. A family
            member took me to our local theater where I got to see
            my first staged work A Raisin In The Sun. I sat glued to my
            chair as I watched this new world unfold in front of me. From there,
            I became active in the community theater. I then developed a love for
            dance, visual arts, and vocal music. Though I am only active in a few
            art mediums right now, I am always looking for new avenues
            of expression.
